    "This week we're learning the basics of handling files for reading in and writing out.  We're used to our operating systems handling all these things for us, so we need to reproduce those backend mechanisms ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic pattern is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the file in whichever mode you need\n",
    "2. Do stuff to that file.\n",
    "3. Close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways of handling files in sort of a one shot, but we'll get to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't curse the cursor!  When you open a file for reading, there's an invisible cursor that the system places within that file.  It starts at the very beginning of the file and moves forward at your direction.  This means you can direct it to go forward character by character or line by line.  But you can never move backwards!  This means that you cannot 'reread' a file once you've already done a read action to it.  Once the cursor has found the end of the file, it stops and waits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You open a file for reading\n",
    "2. You use `.read()` on that file.  The cursor is now at the end of the file.\n",
    "3. You cannot then use `.readlines()` on it after because `.readlines()` is going to attempt to start reading from the end of that file.  You'll get nothing."

As we saw with our `range(5)` example, we can call `.readline()` an arbitrary number of times.
