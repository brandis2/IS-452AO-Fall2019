So think, in a world where there were a minimal homework problems that week and you're an expert who ran into no problems, you should still write at least 300 words.  I don't expect you to need to go over 1000, though.  Please don't.  So somewhere between 300-500-700, depending on how many problems there were to complete, should get the job done just fine.\n",

    "\n",
    "We haven't talked about functions yet, so this is a pretty annoying \"roll with it\" stage.  I personally wouldn't have incorporated this style so quickly in the book, but in an effort to be coherent, we'll use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep your indents in order.\n",
    "    * Everything tabbed in under the `def` line will 'belong' to that function.\n",
    "* None of the code within the `def main():` block will run if you don't 'call' the function.\n",
    "    * Perfect looking script executing without an output?  This is likely the culprit.\n",
    "    * You need to have a `main()` as your last line of code without any indents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    print(\"fizzy pop sandwich\")\n",
    "    # more code goes here\n",
    "\n",
    "main() # last line, no indents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This style of script construction is not _required_ for Python, but will seem more logical as we go on and build more complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On `range()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there are two ways to handle `range()`.  For those who need it more explicitly, you can see this in the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#ranges  There are two formations of this function, and the one that is called depends on how many parameters (the stuff within the `()`) you pass it."
