    "# Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries work like the mental model you probably have a dictionary. There are keys, these are the things that will be defined, and there are values or the definitions of the key. Dictionaries in Python are a lot like lists in that they hold collections of data.  However, as we discussed with for loops, they have fundamentally different purposes. As a result, they act in very different ways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Important Tips:* Don't try to understand dictionaries like you understand lists.  Yes, they each hold things, but that's where similarites stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best way to consider dictionaries is as a small database. There are two pieces: unique IDs, and associated records. As noted in the first sentence, we call these keys and values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Think of an apartment building\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data is all around us. In fact, we tend to sort things out this way when given a chance. Take, for example, an apartment. For ease of use, let's call it *your* apartment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your apartment has a unique address.  First off, the street address tells you which unique buildng you want to find.  There may be several identical buildings, but each has a unique address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that apartment building there are unit IDs.  These may be letters (A, B, etc), labels (Garden, Penthouse, etc), or numbers (6, 303. etc).  Many apartment buildings share the same numbering systems, and this is fine because that apartment belongs to that building.  So the unique combination of street address and unit number can uniquly identify a unit in the same city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside these units you can hold whatever you want.  Usually household goods, food, pets, collectables, human bodies, etc.  The idea is that in order to access this unit, you must go into a building and enter a specific ID.  The IDs in that unit must be unique.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to access things in order.  So you can't just directly go into an apartment number.  Even if that apartment door is outside, you still have to find the building.  Imagine saying, \"Hi, I live in New York City and I likein apartment 3.  The party will be at 8pm.\"  Will anyone be at your party?  Not so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analogy, the building is our dictionary.  The street address is our variable name, and the unit number is our key.  You use the key with the variable name to access the contents of that unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's pretty much it."
