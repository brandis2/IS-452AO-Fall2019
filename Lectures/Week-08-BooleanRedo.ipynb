    "There are roughly 3 kinds of purposes for using a decision structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filtering\n",
    "    * used for tossing out data or retaining something\n",
    "    * examples: tossing out empty string\n",
    "    * these usually look like small if/else statements.\n",
    "2. Complex boolean decision trees\n",
    "    * used to encode complex logic trees with branching logic, etc. These are often used to classify things, make a decision about something, etc. There are ofter a complex set of rules to go along with things.\n",
    "    * examples: determining if a year is a leap year.\n",
    "    * these often look like heavily nested if statments, have complex booleans, etc.\n",
    "3. Case/switch statements\n",
    "    * used to assign an approprate value or label. Ususually these are times when you don't have a lot of overlab between the categories, and just need to determine which label something needs or an action.\n",
    "    * example: determining the letter grade of a score\n",
    "    * these often look like a long chain of if/elif/else staments with little branching. The order of control flow in the stamment presumes that all the previous categories are true, so there is usalally littly compound boolean stamements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The purpose of having these categories is to help you understand and classify the kinds of situations where these are used and how their needs determine the approach.  These are also very general descriptions, so there will often be hybrid situations or tasks that are a mix of some or all of these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a note, you can nest an in statement under another if statement.  I generally try to avoid this and retool the logic, but there are sometimes when it just makes more sense."

    "Last week we covered the core concepts of using booleans in our programs.  We covered if/else, and today we'll cover expanding this into the if/elif/else combination.  This allows us to create larger boolean blocks to have more precise control over the processing flow of our program.\n",
